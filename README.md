# SilentFlareGTOS

Markdown + GitHub Pages policy library for the SilentFlare personal blog Global Terms of Service.

This repository is for a personal blog / personal web presence. It is not a VPS, hosting, payment, SaaS, or commercial infrastructure service agreement unless SilentFlare publishes a separate written product-specific agreement.

## Deploy with GitHub Pages

Use GitHub Pages with Jekyll:

```text
Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: main
Folder: /docs
```

After deployment, the site entry is the Pages URL for this repository. Each policy page has its own stable route, for example:

```text
/terms/overview/
/terms/restricted-regions/
/terms/kyc/
/terms/acceptable-use/
/terms/data-privacy/
```

## Editing rules

- Write policy text in Markdown, not handwritten HTML.
- Keep one policy category per file.
- Keep the documents suitable for a personal blog, not a commercial hosting platform.
- Keep the restricted-region list in `docs/terms/restricted-regions.md` only.
- Keep the limited KYC1 rule in `docs/terms/kyc.md` only.
- Do not add KYC2, KYC3, proof-of-address, source-of-funds, or commercial onboarding unless the site changes into a commercial service.
- Update `docs/index.md` when adding, removing, or renaming policy files.

## Legal review notice

This repository is an operational policy draft for a personal blog. It is not legal advice. Review it with a qualified legal professional before relying on it for commercial use, identity verification, restricted-region enforcement, GDPR compliance, or German/EU internet-law compliance.
